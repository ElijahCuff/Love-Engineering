Step-by-Step guide for making someone like you back üíò
"If you got given a secret formula to making your crush fall in love with you, would you use it on them knowing you're manipulating them ?"

This is for people,
‚Ä¢ who don't understand why they have people stuck in their mind.
‚Ä¢ who would consider themselves a hopeless romantic and need information on how a usual relationship starts.

This guide is not for people,
‚Ä¢ who wish to use means of manipulation.

Disclaimer,
‚Ä¢ It is strongly discouraged to seek a relationship with someone who is in a healthy and happy relationship already üíï - be happy for them, if they aren't in a happy relationship well that's a different story.
‚Ä¢ This guide was created through professional advice, including psychologists and relationship pattern experts.
‚Ä¢ The guides effects also backfire and you can't stop thinking about them either !!!

‚ù£Ô∏è FINDING SOMEONE
 Meet someone at a party ? - ask if they want a friend request.
See someone at a store ? - ask if they're single üïµÔ∏è
You'll find a way to meet someone or several people.

‚Ä¢ A minimum of 2 people is recommended, 1 person is your primary choice and the other is your backup, a failsafe fallback )
( This guide is designed to be used on multiple people simultaneously, increasing chances drastically per person... )

‚ù£Ô∏è GET NOTICED.
 First you need to get them to even notice you or know you exist at all, you can do this in a few ways - the most common ways would be,

‚Ä¢ Visit their place of work and say hi.
‚Ä¢ Go and see them with a mutual friend, maybe they're going to a party together.
‚Ä¢ Attend the same event's as them to be seen in the background, study's show that women are more interested in elusive men - ( see references )
‚Ä¢ Send them some likes on social media pictures or post's to bring attention to yourself - make them see you and know your name.
‚Ä¢ Comment on their stuff, give reactions and try to be " Sweet, Clean and Direct ", don't overdo it.
        

‚ù£Ô∏è START A CONVERSATION ( Getting Noticed Pt 2 )
 Now that they have noticed you a little bit, it's time to start up a friendly chat - maybe a text, inbox on social media or walkup to them and chat ??
 
‚Ä¢ Here's where you can ask for a number to continue the connection offline ( OR AFTER THE INITIAL CONVERSATION ) üíï
  ( BE CAREFUL NOT TO COME ON TOO STRONG, OR NOT STRONG ENOUGH... 
     IT TAKES PRACTICE !!! )
  - NOT STRONG ENOUGH : You will seem to lack confidence and important social skills.
  - TOO STRONG : You will appear as a sleazy person or someone rather obsessed.
   
  ( Maybe wait until the 3rd or 4th interaction before asking for a number ).

‚ù£Ô∏è GETTING YOURSELF STUCK IN THEIR HEAD
 Now it's important to chat as much as they will allow you too !!!
 ( Big Emphasis on "Allow You Too" )
    
    Important,
          ‚Ä¢ Be careful with this step, you don't want to "over" do it and become annoying or "under" do it and allow them to forget you over time.
          ‚Ä¢ Send them a good morning message and sweet dreams message each night, reminding them that you are there and you care.
          ‚Ä¢ Try not to become annoying but also check how they're doing at work - that gives them something to think about through the day.
    
    This will allow them to think about you before bed, after work and as soon as they wake up each morning !! 

          ‚Ä¢ 3 messages a day to initiate a conversation is the ultimate target.
          ‚Ä¢ it takes sometimes only 14 to 28 days to create a new addiction forming habit - this is the target for 1 months time.
          ‚Ä¢ Important to ALWAYS ask how their day has been to show them you care about them and keep yourself in their head as much as possible.
          ‚Ä¢ Someone deeply caring about you is easier to associate with the feelings of love.
         ‚Ä¢ Dedicating a song to them can be extremely beneficial to induce memories through music at a later date.

Example,
          ‚Ä¢ "He sends me sweet good morning messages to wake up too and think about him all day ü•≤ and sweet dreams messages to dream about him all night."  
         ‚Ä¢ "Why do you like them ? - Well, i can't stop thinking about them, we do fun things together, they always show they care about me, i can't wait to see what we do next time we see each other."

The point to chatting frequently is not for "getting to know each other" ( although that helps ) - it is to make yourself a constant thought in the back of their mind.
    

before bed, when they wake up, when they knock off work, when they do anything ( even listen to music ) - they'll be subconsciously reminded of you, eventually in a habitual and addictive way.

‚ù£Ô∏è DOING SOMETHING TOGETHER ( GETTING YOURSELF STUCK IN THEIR HEAD Pt.2 )
  It's now important for you to do something together - make some great memories together,
            ( ONLY GOOD MEMORIES UNLESS THEY LIKE DRAMA, example ;
              "Remember when we would fight for days, it was so cute..." )

     ‚Ä¢ Try going out for coffee or going for a run together ( maybe going to the movies ).
       - You need them to remember you as someone that "likes doing things with them, going for a run or walk is a good idea !"
       - You need them to remember having great times with you, even if that's just watching a movie together or having a laugh while talking at a party - that allows them to see you as a fun and entertaining person to be around.

‚ù£Ô∏è LET THEM KNOW YOU'RE INTERESTED
             ‚Ä¢ Start adding some xx's to your messages, and see if they send you some back.
                ( if they start ignoring you, they probably don't feel the same way )

             ‚Ä¢ Try calling them Babe, Hun, Bub or something along those lines and see how they respond
                ( try to act accordingly and respect their wishes - that can EXTREMELY bebeneficial in the long run. )
         
         IMPORTANT,
             ‚Ä¢ It's important to not overdose them here, and become clingy or overwhelming, and also not to 
               underdose them and allow them to start thinking you're "friend zoning" them..

‚ù£Ô∏è HIT THEM WITH THE QUESTION 
              ‚Ä¢  Tell them that you like them and ask them if they would be interested in pursuing a relationship with you ?
                 ( Big Emphasis on "Persuing" a relationship, women love that word üòâ)

‚ù£Ô∏è METHODOLOGICAL ANALYSIS
     ~ EFFECTS AND NOTES,
              ‚Ä¢ Because you are caring and genuinely want them to experience good times with you, you will easily start to become more appealing as an option.
              ‚Ä¢ Through being reminded of you each morning, day and night, you will eventually become a habitual pattern even when you don't send any messages.
              ‚Ä¢ They just can't get you out of their head üôÜ - when they wake up & before they go to bed.
   
"BECAUSE YOU ARE SEEN AS A NICE CARING PERSON, THEY ONLY HAVE GREAT MEMORIES WITH YOU AND ALSO THEY THINK ABOUT YOU OFTEN - IT BECOMES EASIER TO INITIATE A RELATIONSHIP."
    
    

üßë‚Äçüî¨ CHEMISTRY BREAKDOWN.
        GUIDE IS BASED ON TIMED AND HABITUAL DELIVERY OF SEROTONIN ( AND OTHER CHEMICALS ) IN ASSOCIATION WITH AN INDIVIDUAL OR MEMORY.

               ‚Ä¢  Love is a mix of addictive chemicals created by the human
                  brain, you manage the targeted delivery of these chemicals
                 in association with yourself or specific actions.

               ‚Ä¢ Love & Sex can be used as a POWERFUL weapon, it's even
                 found in use by law enforcement agencies - nicknamed
               "Sexpionage".

Freewill Is Important To Consider and Obtain !!!

The Attraction Of An Elusive Man,
"I am pretty fucking sure that a large part of what makes a man deeply attractive in the early stages of getting to know them is their elusiveness. For some women, the more obscure, alternative and different they are the deeper the attraction.
For other women, the more unavailable they seem to the rest of the world, but available to the woman herself, the deeper the attraction." https://medium.com/@safiakat/the-allure-of-elusive-men-73c5b9b272b3

Habit Forming Patterns,
"It can take anywhere from 18 to 254 days for a person to form a new habit and an average of 66 days for a new behavior to become automatic. 
There‚Äôs no one-size-fits-all figure, which is why this time frame is so broad; some habits are easier to form than others, and some people may find it easier to develop new behaviors."

Feelings Associated With Love,
"When you experience deep love for someone, you want to share every part of your life with them. You want to recall the events of your day to them. And you want to be as much a part of their life as you want them to be in yours. You share your secrets with them."
